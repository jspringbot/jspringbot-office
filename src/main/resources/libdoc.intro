= Examples =

There are two ways you can use this library. First by creating a simple word document, and by using a document as template word document with replaceable variables.

== Creation ==

This example shows you how to create a simple word document of type DOCX (Office Open XML word processing document).

| Word Create |
| Word Insert Text | Sample Text |
| Word Insert Paragraph Break |
| Word Insert Image | classpath:images/a.png |
| Word Insert Page Break |
| Word Insert Hyperlink | jspringbot.org | http://jspringbot.org |
| Word Save As | /tmp/created.docx | DOCX |

=>

| This will create a "created.docx" file of type "DOCX" microsoft document

== Template ==

This example shows how this library can be used for word document templates.

| Word Open File | classpath:templates/template1.docx |
| Word Replace Text | @date | March 2, 2015 |
| Word Replace Text | @user | Alvin |
| ${image1}= | Element Capture Screenshot | css=#section |
| Word Replace Text As Image | @image1 | ${image1} |
| Word Save As | /tmp/created.doc | DOC |

=>

| this uses "template1.docx" as Word document template
| this replaces some replaceable text items
| this also captures a web page section (css=#section) and replaces that item in the document
| save the document and convert to "DOC" type.
